## Download

### Via Zip File

Download the project as a Zip File and exctract the whole content into a 
directory of your choice.

### Via git

For the purpose of having the same development environment on every 
system each of my git projects is deployed in a *git* Folder in the Root 
Directory.
To get the same Folder enter the following on your commandline. 

```bash
cd /
mkdir git
cd git
```

After successfully creating the directory (if it doesen't allready 
exist) you can go ahead and clone the repository via git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/socialyzeio/vrchatExampleMap.git
```

## Setting up the Project

Start Unity and Open the Project through the [Open] Option in the first 
window or over *File* -> *Open Project...* when you are allready on the 
Main Screen.
Now you only need to login to your vrchat Account in *VRChatSDK* -> 
*Settings* and you are finished.

## Building the Project (Open the Map in VRChat)

The Project can be build and started over *VRChatSDK* -> *Show Build 
Control Panel* here you need to click [Build & Publish].
Now you can enter the name of the character and submit it for uploading 
and you can see it ingame in the next few seconds.
